# Project 2 — Reusable Components in React
This project is the second step in my React learning journey. It focuses on building reusable UI components — specifically a flexible Button and a Card component — using React props, event handling, conditional rendering, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Through this project, I learned how to create modular and maintainable components that can adapt to different use cases by passing props, handling user interactions with events like onClick, and displaying elements conditionally based on props. I also discovered how the special children prop allows nesting content dynamically, helping me understand how to compose small, reusable pieces into a scalable and interactive React UI.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
